You are an expert in electronics design, KiCad v9.x, and technical documentation, capable of generating accurate KiCad project files, repair diagrams, and user manuals. I need you to create a complete set of KiCad v9.x project files, a printed circuit repair diagram, and a user manual for a 500W push-pull amplifier using MHT1803A/B) transistors, designed for a mobile setup operating on 1.8 to 30MHz  supporting  AM, SSB, and FM modes. The design must meet the following specifications:
 
 Project Requirements:
 
 Amplifier Core:
 Use two MHT1803A/B in a push-pull configuration for 500W output power, optimized for 1.8 to 30MHz
 Low distortion Class B push-pull operation, as per the MHT1803 datasheet .
 Input power: 6-8W for 500W output, with bias disable pads for VSWR protection.
 
 Power Supply:
 Input: 12-14 VDC from a mobile power source (e.g., vehicle battery).
 Include a DC-DC converter to step up 12.5V to 50V for the MHT1803 transistors, handling 20-28A at 48V.
 Use 4 AWG power and ground wires connected via screw terminals.
 Include a main power status LED (green, 3mm, through-hole).
 
 Band and Mode Selection:
 Include a rotary switch (1-pole, 5-position) for band selection (10m, 12m, 40m, 20m, 80M) controlling antenna output routing.
 Include a mode switch (1-pole, 3-position) for AM, SSB, or FM modes, affecting modulation circuitry.
.
 
 Connectors:
Two SO-239 connectors: one for radio input, one for  output, 
 One SMA connector for additional radio input.
 Ensure connectors are robust for mobile use with proper grounding.
 
 Thermal Management:
 Integrate a 240mm AIO liquid cooler (radiator and fan externally mounted on top) for MHT1803 transistors and heatsink.
 Include overheat detection using a temperature sensor (e.g., NTC thermistor or LM35) near the transistors, triggering power cutoff (via relay or MOSFET switch) if temperature exceeds 85°C.
 Include an overheat status LED (red, 3mm, through-hole).
 
 PCB Design Considerations:
 Use microstrip technology for RF matching and impedance control.
 Mount MHT1803 transistors and PCB to a CNC-machined aluminum heatsink compatible with the AIO liquid cooler.
 Design for a 200mm x 150mm board, suitable for a mobile enclosure.
 Use high-temperature, low-impedance Teflon coax for matching transformers.
 Use surface-mount components where possible, designed for reflow soldering.
 Ensure grounding and shielding for minimal RF interference.
 
 KiCad File Requirements:
 Generate a KiCad v9.x project with:
 Schematic file (MHT1803_Amplifier_500W.kicad_sch): Include all components (MHT1803 LDmos, DC-DC converter, switches, connectors,  temperature sensor, power cutoff circuitry, screw terminals, passives).
 PCB layout file (MHT1803_Amplifier_500W.kicad_pcb): Include RF trace routing, thermal vias under MHT1803, and mounting holes for heatsink and AIO cooler.
 Symbol library file (MHT1803_Amplifier_500W.kicad_sym): Custom symbols for MHT1803 (M244 package), SO-239, SMA, switches, etc.
 Footprint library file (MHT1803_Amplifier_500W.pretty): Footprints for all components, including MHT1803, connectors, and AIO cooler mounts.
 Project file (MHT1803_Amplifier_500W.kicad_pro): Configure for KiCad 9.x, with design rules for high-power RF (50V traces, 4 AWG support).
 Ensure KiCad 9.x syntax compatibility for schematic editor, PCB editor, and 3D viewer.
 Wrap each file in an <xaiArtifact> tag with a unique UUID for artifact_id, appropriate title, and correct contentType (e.g., text/kicad_sch, text/kicad_pcb, text/kicad_sym, text/kicad_mod, text/kicad_pro).
 Include a bill of materials (BOM) in CSV format (bom.csv) with part numbers, descriptions, and sources (e.g., Mouser, DigiKey), wrapped in an <xaiArtifact> tag with contentType="text/csv".
 
 Printed Circuit Repair Diagram:
 Generate a repair diagram to assist technicians in troubleshooting and repairing the PCB.
 Format: SVG or PDF, suitable for printing.
 Content:
 Highlight key components (MHT1803 MOSFETs, DC-DC converter, temperature sensor, relay, connectors, switches, LEDs).
 Label test points for critical signals (e.g., 12.5V input, 50V output, RF input/output, temperature sensor output).
 Include a troubleshooting guide (e.g., check LED statuses, measure voltages at test points, verify switch positions).
 Show thermal vias and heatsink mounting points for thermal troubleshooting.
 Annotate common failure points (e.g., MOSFET failure, DC-DC converter issues, connector damage).
 Wrap the file in an <xaiArtifact> tag with contentType="image/svg+xml" (for SVG) or text/latex" (for PDF, using LaTeX to generate a diagram with TikZ).
 Title: MHT1803_Amplifier_500W_Repair_Diagram.
 
 User Manual:
 Generate a user manual for operating the amplifier in a mobile setup.

 Additional Notes:
 Reference the MHT1803 datasheet for electrical characteristics and pinout.
 Use standard KiCad libraries where possible; create custom symbols/footprints for non-standard components (e.g., MHT1803, SO-239, SMA).
 For the DC-DC converter, select a module (e.g., Vicor DCM3623T50T53A6T00 or TI LM5122) for 12.5V to 50V at 20-22A.
 Assume an NTC thermistor or LM35 for overheat detection, with a comparator for the 85°C threshold.
 Ensure the repair diagram and user manual are consistent with the PCB design and component layout.
 For LaTeX, use PDFLaTeX with packages from texlive-full and texlive-fonts-extra (e.g., noto for fonts, tikz for diagrams).

 Note any assumptions (e.g., DC-DC converter model, temperature sensor type) in the explanation.

 KiCad 9.0.2 is strict about rotation values and only accepts 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.

Potential issues to pay attention to:
1. Incomplete symbol definitions in lib_symbols section
2. Missing component instances (comparator, relay, etc.)
3. Incorrect wire connections or missing nets
4. UUID references that don't match
5. Missing electrical connections between components
6. Incomplete symbol graphics in lib_symbols
7. Power connections not properly defined
8. expecting font, justify, hide or href
